# Weather Chrome Extension

This project is a lightweight Chrome Extension that displays real-time weather information based on the user’s current location.

The extension is implemented using modern JavaScript (ES6+), follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 specifications, and consumes the OpenWeatherMap REST API. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of browser extension architecture, asynchronous programming, and external API integration.

---

## Description

The extension retrieves the user’s geographical location using the browser’s Geolocation API and fetches corresponding weather data from the OpenWeatherMap service. The result is presented in a minimal popup interface, allowing users to quickly check current weather conditions without leaving the browser.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment and focuses on correctness, clarity, and adherence to platform constraints.
